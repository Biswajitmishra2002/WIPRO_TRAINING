Hypervisior tool 
	- a tool to achieve virtualization
	- 2 types
		1. Type-1 HV
			- bare matel HV
			- installed on top on physical machine & do not require an OS.
			- ex:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
				- VMWare ESXi
				- Citrix Xenservers
		2. Type-2 HV
			- guest-based / OS-based HV
			- installed on top of your current operating system.
			- ex:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
			- Oracle Virtual Box
				- VMWare workstation
				- Linux KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
				
IP addresses
	1. Private IP address
	2. Public IP address
		- Dynamic Public IP address
			- IP will change 
		- Static Public IP address
			- IP will NOT change 
			
Assign/Give the IP address:
--------------------------
1. DHCP (Dynamic Host Config Protocol)
2. Manually assigning
	ncpa.cpl --> select nic and add manually
3. APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)
	- range: 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254 (169.254.X.X)
	
Classes in IP address (IPv4)
----------------------------
	11111111.1111111.00000000.11110000
			  192.168.0.10
			  
5 classes (0-255 = 256)
	Class A -> 0-127	-> used for huge networks of hosts
	Class B -> 128-191	-> used for medium size networks
	Class C -> 192-223	-> used for local area network (LAN)
	Class D -> 224-239	-> Reserved
	Class E -> 240-255	-> Reserved
	
0.0.0.0 		-> Any network
10.0.0.0		-> used for assigning Class A private IP address
127.0.0.1		-> Loop back IP address.
172.16.0.0		-> used for assigning Class B private IP address
192.168.0.0		-> used for assigning Class C private IP address



OSI Model
-----------
1. Physical Layer		=> Transmits raw data over the cable.
2. Data Link Layer		=> Manages communication between devices on the same network segment
3. Network Layer		=> Routes the data packets across diff networks.
4. Transport Layer		=> Provides reliable data delivery and manages end-to-end communication
5. Session Layer		=> Establishes, maintain & terminates session between application
6. Presentation Layer		=> Translates data into a format that application can understand.
7. Application Layer		=> Provides interface for user application to access n/w services.


TCP/IP Model

1. Application layer
2. Transport layer
3. Network layer
